# Static Code Testing Demo

This repository demonstrates a static code testing workflow using Synk for security vulnerability scanning and GitHub Actions for automation. The project utilizes the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) for building and serving a static website.

## Overview

The demo showcases the following components and workflows:

- **Synk**: Synk is used for static code analysis to identify security vulnerabilities in the project dependencies.
- **GitHub Actions Workflow**: GitHub Actions is configured to automate the static code testing process, integrating Synk security scanning into the workflow.
- **LAMP Stack**: The LAMP stack is utilized for building and serving the static website. It consists of Linux as the operating system, Apache as the web server, MySQL as the database, and PHP as the server-side scripting language.

## Features

- Automated security vulnerability scanning using Synk.
- Continuous integration and static code testing with GitHub Actions.
- Deployment of the static website using the LAMP stack.
